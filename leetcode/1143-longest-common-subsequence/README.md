## Problem Statement

<p>Given two strings <code>text1</code> and <code>text2</code>, return <em>the length of their longest <strong>common subsequence</strong>. </em>If there is no <strong>common subsequence</strong>, return <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>A <strong>subsequence</strong> of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.</p>

<ul>
	<li>For example, <code>&quot;ace&quot;</code> is a subsequence of <code>&quot;abcde&quot;</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <strong>common subsequence</strong> of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> text1 = &quot;abcde&quot;, text2 = &quot;ace&quot; 
<strong>Output:</strong> 3  
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The longest common subsequence is &quot;ace&quot; and its length is 3.
</pre>

<p>
```

**Example 2:**

```
</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> text1 = &quot;abc&quot;, text2 = &quot;abc&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The longest common subsequence is &quot;abc&quot; and its length is 3.
</pre>

<p>
```

**Example 3:**

```
</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> text1 = &quot;abc&quot;, text2 = &quot;def&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
```

## Constraints

- <code>1 &lt;= text1.length, text2.length &lt;= 1000</code>
- <code>text1</code> and <code>text2</code> consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Solution

```py
class Solution(object):
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1, text2):
        n = len(text1)
        m = len(text2)
        dp = [[-1] * m for _ in range(n)]

        def f(i, j):
            if i == n or j == m:
                return 0
            if dp[i][j] != -1:
                return dp[i][j]
            if text1[i] == text2[j]:
                dp[i][j] = 1 + f(i + 1, j + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(f(i + 1, j),f(i, j + 1))
            return dp[i][j]
        return f(0, 0)
```
